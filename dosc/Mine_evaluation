Zwolnieni z Teorii; a programme that greatly developed our programming and communication skills, but it must be emphasised that it was not easy.
But let's start from the beginning. After coming up with the idea and the main concept for the project, we were very happy, everything seemed great to us, and we immediately got down to designing. 
Unfortunately, our initial attempts at learning and writing the application did not go according to plan. Both Frank and I had problems with where to start learning and how to go about writing the application. 
Fortunately for us, Mr Marcin Mora≈Ñski came to our aid and, thanks to his experience, showed us the way forward. However, there were obstacles here too, as studying for mock exams and learning programming from scratch is not the best combination and caused us a lot of difficulties. 

We are extremely pleased with the results of our work. The application is fully functional, and although millions of new ideas have emerged, we were able to continue and finalise our project. 
Our application works seamlessly, everyone can see everyone else on the map, anyone can write a message, and everything works very smoothly and stably. We are incredibly happy that we managed to finalise the application, as the road to success was very bumpy. 
Our SMART goal, although with minor delays, was fully achieved and we were able to complete each of the required tasks. Although the application operates on a small scale and we have not yet managed to reach the required 200 beneficiaries, its effects are already visible. One of our rather shy colleagues was able to communicate about the transition, and the joy of writing to each other between classrooms was indescribable. 
We are very pleased with the results of our project because it has brought us a lot of good, which is why we are very keen to reach the beneficiaries.
